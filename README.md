Capacitance and Types of Capacitors
1. Introduction
Capacitance describes how well a system can store electric charge. Think of it like a calm storage bin for electric energy: the larger the capacitance, the more charge it can hold at a given voltage.

Capacitors show up everywhere, from phone chargers to satellites. This README walks through three classic geometries:

Parallel Plate Capacitor
Coaxial Cylindrical Capacitor
Spherical Capacitor
Images are added between sections for clarity (you can replace placeholders with your own diagrams).

2. What Is Capacitance?
Capacitance C is defined as the amount of charge stored per unit voltage:

C = Q / V
A capacitor's geometry, the distance between conductors, and the permittivity of the material all shape how much charge it can stockpile.

3. Parallel Plate Capacitor
The simplest one: two flat, parallel metal plates separated by a small gap. A uniform electric field grows between them like neat rows of wheat.

Capacitance Formula
C = (ε₀ · ε_r · A) / d
Where:

ε₀ = permittivity of free space
ε_r = relative permittivity of dielectric material
A = area of plates
d = separation distance
Key Features
High capacitance for small separation
Used in sensors, filters, and integrated circuits
Electric field is mostly uniform
4. Coaxial Cylindrical Capacitor
Now picture one hollow cylinder wrapped around another smaller cylinder, like an electrical Russian nesting doll.

Capacitance Formula
C = (2π · ε₀ · ε_r · L) / ln(b/a)
Where:

a = radius of inner cylinder
b = radius of outer cylinder
L = length of the cylinders
Key Features
Perfect for cables (like coaxial TV cables)
Cylindrical symmetry keeps fields locked neatly inside
Less electromagnetic interference
5. Spherical Capacitor
Imagine one metal sphere floating inside another. Charge gathers on both shells, and the electric field spreads between them like layered air around a planet.

Capacitance Formula
C = 4π · ε₀ · ε_r · (a · b) / (b - a)
Where:

a = radius of inner sphere
b = radius of outer sphere
Key Features
Highly symmetric
Used in specialized high-voltage experiments
Neat theoretical model for isolated spherical charge storage
6. Energy Stored in a Capacitor
Regardless of shape, every capacitor stores electrostatic energy:

U = (1/2) · C · V²
This is like a tiny silent vault holding electric potential until needed.

7. Summary Table
Type of Capacitor	Formula	Where It Excels
Parallel Plate	C = (ε₀·ε_r·A)/d	ICs, sensors, lab experiments
Coaxial Cylinder	C = (2π·ε₀·ε_r·L)/ln(b/a)	Communication cables, RF circuits
Spherical	C = 4π·ε₀·ε_r·(a·b)/(b-a)	High-voltage setups, theoretical models
8. Conclusion
Capacitors may look simple, but their shapes quietly sculpt the electric field inside them. By choosing the right geometry—flat, cylindrical, or spherical—engineers can tailor how much charge fits in a given space and how cleanly signals travel through cables.

Whether powering a camera flash or stabilizing voltage in a circuit board, capacitors are the silent workhorses of modern electronics.
